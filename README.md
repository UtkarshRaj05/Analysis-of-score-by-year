# Analysis-of-score-by-year


# Conclusion based on the provided graphs:

# 1. Run Distribution: The distribution of total runs in ODIs shows a tendency towards scores within a specific range, likely with a right skew indicating more lower scoring matches.  Further analysis of the histogram's peaks would reveal more details on scoring patterns.

# 2. Top Run Scorers: Virat Kohli is the highest run scorer by a significant margin, highlighting his dominance.  Other top players like MS Dhoni and AB de Villiers show consistent performance despite different batting styles.

# 3. Balls Faced: Virat Kohli and Kumar Sangakkara have faced the most deliveries, suggesting their longevity and consistency in the game.  AB de Villiers's fewer balls faced, despite high runs, point to a higher strike rate.

# 4. Team Performance: India and Australia have scored the most runs, indicating historical dominance.  Sri Lanka, South Africa, and England follow, with smaller nations scoring considerably less, possibly due to less frequent participation in international matches.

# 5. Strike Rate vs. Total Runs: Virat Kohli exhibits both high total runs and a good strike rate, highlighting his all-around batting prowess. AB de Villiers has a high strike rate, indicating an aggressive style.  Other players show a varied balance between accumulating runs and scoring quickly.

# 6. Top Wicket-Takers: Lasith Malinga stands out as the leading wicket-taker, emphasizing his bowling dominance.  The list is dominated by fast bowlers, with a few spinners making the top 10.

# 7. Player of the Match Awards:  The players with the most player of the match awards generally overlap with the top run-scorers and wicket-takers, but further analysis could be done to see if the award correlation changes over time or playing conditions.

# 8. Team Batting Averages: Shows a comparison of the average runs per team.

# 9. Total Runs vs. Balls Faced: A detailed relationship between runs and balls faced, again supporting the observation that some players (e.g., AB de Villiers) have high run rates (more runs in fewer balls faced).

# Overall Conclusion:

# The dataset demonstrates key trends in ODI cricket.  India and Australia are top-performing teams in terms of total runs. Virat Kohli stands out as a dominant batsman with both high total runs and a good strike rate, while Lasith Malinga is the leading wicket-taker.  The data reveals variations in batting styles among top players, from accumulators to aggressive scorers, and highlights the differing performance levels of established cricketing nations compared to smaller or associate nations. Further in-depth analysis could explore correlations between various statistics, the impact of different playing conditions, and the evolution of player performance over time.
